"""Unit tests for :class:`HarnessProcessManager` model-change respawn.

The harness model is a fixed process env var (``HARNESS_<H>_MODEL``), baked
in at spawn time. So a later turn requesting a different model — e.g. after
the user runs ``/model`` — must respawn the subprocess; otherwise the cached
process keeps serving the old model and ``/model`` silently has no effect.
These tests mock the subprocess-spawn boundary (``_spawn_entry`` /
``_close_entry``) so they exercise the respawn *decision* in ``get_client``
without launching real runner subprocesses.
